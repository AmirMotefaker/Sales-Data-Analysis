# E-Commerce Sales Analysis

I analyze sales data generated by e-commerce sites like Amazon and answer some questions to increase profits.

      Q1) Which month is best for selling products?

      Q2) Which city orders the highest number of products?

      Q3) What time of the day do people order the most goods online?

      Q4) Which product has the highest demand and why?
